    "The Titanic tragedy needs no introduction. One of the worst ship disasters in history, the crash of RMS Titanic in 1912 was further entrenched in our memories by James Cameron's epic Hollywood movie set against the ill-fated voyage. More than 2200 passengers were onboard the ship that fateful date, and only about 700 survived. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we will investigate the factors that made passengers more likely to survive the tragedy. Many may be familiar with the \"women and children first\" code of conduct that govern emergency evacuations as in the case of Titanic. Thus we should expect to see higher survival rates for women and children. We will verify this from our sample data. In addition, this study will also probe additional research questions: Are \"upper-class\" passengers also more likely to survive than \"lower-class\" passengers? Are adult passengers with children onboard more or less likely to survive? Do these results vary by gender? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we will analyze the sample of 891 passenger data points provided, and plot graphs of relevant predictor variables against survival outcomes. Please note that we are only presenting a \"directional read\" on our research questions. In order to make more definitive conclusions about the data, additional statistical testing will be required which is outside the scope of this project. "

    "The sample contains 891 data points and 12 variables. The ones that are of interest for the project are: \n",

    "1. \"Survived\": Outcome or dependent variable that tells us whether the passenger survived (\"1\") or not (\"0\"). \n",
